# Drakengard 3 XXX To Mp3
This small tool allows you to extract the audio data stored in the .XXX audio files of Drakengard 3 to mp3. there is no quality reduction or any transcoding involved in this extraction process as the audio data inside the XXX files is also in mp3 format.
<br><br>Run this program with the .XXX file as the argument:
<br>``Drakengard3xxxToMp3.exe FileName.XXX``
<br><br>**Important:**  Currently this tool works with the assumption that the audio data stored in the .XXX files is either in mono or stereo channel. if there are more than 2 audio channels stored in the XXX file, then the extracted mp3 file will not play properly as the format itself does not support more than 2 channels.
